# Instructions

### Part 1 Implementing Passport

- Make sure project is not running and open a terminal
    - Install the following packages via npm
        - passport
        - passport-local
        - passport-local-mongoose
        - express-session
- In app.js
    - Since our controllers will use passport, all related declarations must be placed before the app = express() instruction
        - Import passport and express-session
        - Initialize and configure the session object by calling app.use and passing the session object as a method
            - Provide the following values: https://github.com/expressjs/session#readme
                - secret
                - resave
                - saveUninitialized
        - Configure passport before any custom router/controller declaration (app.use())
            - Call app.use and register:
                - passport.initialize()
                - passport.session();
- In the models folder
    - Create User.js
        - Define schema and model the same way as any other model
        - Since this is a special model for user management
            - Import passport-local-mongoose
            - Call userSchema.plugin(plm) to extend the model functionality and use the password salting/hashing feature
- In app.js
    - Link passport to our model that extends passport-local-mongoose
        - Import model
        - Call passport.use and specify a strategy
    - Set passport to read/write user data to/from session object
        - Call passport.serializeUser to write user into to a session variable
        - Call passport deserializeUser to get the information from the session variable
            
### Part 2 Adding Register and Login functionality

- In the Views folder
    - Create register.hbs
    - Create login.hbs
    - Copy the HTML code from the links below (also located in Blackboard) to save time:
        - login.hbs > https://pastebin.com/7GUJ9Fp8
        - register.hbs > https://pastebin.com/N3MF5yFH
- In routes/index.js
    - Add GET handler for '/register' and render register.hbs view with a title
    - Add GET handler for '/login' and render login.hbs view with a title
- In views/layout
    - Add links to login and register to the right side of your navbar
    - Open the site on a browser and try navigating to these pages
- In routes/index.js
    - Import passport module
    - Import User model
    - Add POST handler for '/register' and use the User module to register a new User
        - User.register(new User(), password)
        - Password gets passed as a separate parameter so that it can be hashed
        - If registration is successful
            - Call req.login() and pass the newuser object to log the user in
            - Redirect to /projects page
        - Try creating a new account and view MongoDB collection
        - What's hash and salt?
    - Add POST handler for '/login'
        - Instead of the usual custom middleware callback, call passport.authenticate()
            - Specify strategy name
            - Specify success and failure redirect
            - Add a login failure message
    - Modify the GET handler for '/login to handle login failure messages
        - Get message from req.session.messages
        - Clear out messages
        - Pass the messages to the view
    - In login.hbs
        - Make sure messages are rendered
            - Danger alert for invalid
            - Info alert for prompting the user to enter their credentials
