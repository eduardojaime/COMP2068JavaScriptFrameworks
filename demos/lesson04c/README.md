### Part 1 Creating a Hello World app using Express

- Create an empty folder and open with VS Code
- Create a new file named app.js
- Open a terminal and run the npm init command to initialize the project and generate a package.json file
    - Set main as app.js
    - All other options can be set to their default value
- Afterwards, install Express using the following command in your terminal:
    - npm i express
- In app.js
    - Import the express module and create an instance of the Express application by calling the express() method.
    - Define a port number on which your application will listen for incoming requests.
    - Define a route handler for the root URL (/) of your application. When a GET request is made to the root URL, a response containing "Home Page" will be sent.
    - Use the app.listen() method to start the server and listen for incoming requests on the specified port.
    - Run the application by opening the terminal and executing the following command
        - node app
- Open a browser, navigate to http://localhost:3000 and verify
    - Try navigating to other paths. What do you see?
- To add additional routes, go back to app.js
    - Define additional route handlers for the /hello and /goodbye URLs. 
    - When a GET request is made to these URLs, responses containing "Hello World" and "Goodbye", respectively, will be sent.
    - Run the application by opening the terminal and executing the following command
        - node app
- Open a browser
    - Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and verify
    - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/hello and verify
    - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/goodbye and verify

### Part 2 Scaffolding a Project Template Using the Express Generator Tool

- Create a new folder and open with VS Code
- Open the Terminal
- Install express generator tool globally (only need to do this once)
    - npm i -g express-generator
- Scaffold a new project template with the following command
    - express --view=hbs
- Restore project dependencies
    - npm i
- Run the application by opening the terminal and executing the following command
        - npm start
- Examine the newly created folders and files
    - Views
    - Routes
    - Bin/www
- Answer the following questions:
    - Where is the routing configuration?
        - Open index.js inside the Routes folder, notice how it's structured and exported
        - See how the routing is handled in app.js
    - Where are all the Views?
        - Note views have .hbs extensions because we opted for the Handlebars template engine
        - Pug (formely Jade) is the default and it can be neat to work with but extremely hard to debug due to the importance of indenting
        - Handlebars is closer syntactically to what we may use when we add Angular or React to the UI so we will use it instead of Pug (or EJS)
        - Look at the views – what's new here?  The {{ }} delimiters around server-side values
        - Using Handlebars w/Express Generator: 
            - https://itnext.io/using-handlebars-helpers-with-express-generator-ad163f7f89d6?gi=1e6cc21c7ae3 
- Add an /ABOUT route to your new project
    - Go to index.js and add the new route pointing to /about
        - Add a JSON object to be returned, this would come from MongoDB in a real-life app
    - Go to Views folder and create a new file named about.hbs
        - Add html code to the views using the handlebars syntax
- Add Bootstrap
    - 3 ways to get it:
        - Via CDN https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/ (this is the recommended approach)
        - Download and add to public c folder
        - Install the following packages
            - npm i bootstrap –save
            - npm i jquery –save
            - npm i popper --save
            - Copy bootstrap files over from /node_modules/bootstrap/dist/folder to public/stylesheets
    - Add the corresponding bootstrap links in layout.hbs
    - Add menu bar to the template https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/bootstrap_navbar.php
    - Add a jumbotron header to the template https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/bootstrap_jumbotron.php
- You can also consider using Bootstrap Themes for your projects:
    - https://startbootstrap.com/themes?showVue=false&showPro=false
    - https://themes.getbootstrap.com/

### Part 3 Deploying the app to Render.com

- Create a new repository for your project (public preferably)
    - Remember to add a .gitignore file for Node
    - Upload your code to the repository
- Check instructions here https://geshan.com.np/blog/2021/01/free-nodejs-hosting/#render
- Navigate to Render.com
- Sign up and create a Free Account (using GitHub account to sign up is recommended)
    - Add a new Web Service
    - Connect to GitHub Repo using your credentials
    - Modify build command to npm install
    - Modify start command to npm start
    - Navigate to your app link, e.g.: https://render-app-test-m9ki.onrender.com
- Alternatively, if you connect Render to a repository that contains subfolders, you can indicate which subfolder contains the code you wish to deploy:
    - Create a Web App as indicated above
    - Once the app is created, deployment will likely fail with an error
    - Open your Web App Dashboard
    - On the left-hand side menu, select Settings (last option)
        - Scroll down to Build & Deploy
        - Identify Root Directory option and click the Edit button next to it
        - Enter the path to the folder which contains the code. E.g. subfolder/project
        - Set build command
            - npm install
        - Set start command
            - npm start
