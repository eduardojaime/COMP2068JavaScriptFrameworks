What is NPM?
- Node Package Manager 
- Repository for packages (WEB) & CLI for installing these packages (Terminal > npm i)
- Packages become dependencies in our project (why? how?)
  - Project depends on these packages
  - App needs this files on the server to run
  - Knowing which version is in use is important
- Packages are stored in the node_mules folder
- package.json
